================================================================
Executing the File
================================================================
To execute the set of scripts, navigate to the firewall_1.sh file
in your console and run the following command:

	./firewall_1.sh

If you are having difficulty running the program, and you are getting
permission errors, please run the following command with root
privileges:

	chmod 777 firewall_1.sh

The script will run and your netfilter firewall should be functional
according to the criteria set by Assignment 1.

================================================================
Editing the File
================================================================
If you wish to change some of the port variables, ensure that you
are competent with netfilter, firewall implementations and networking
administration. Otherwise, it is highly recommended that you leave
the firewall script alone.

When editing the firewall_1.sh file, the first section is the user
section, where variables can be changed according to rules and 
regulations. You may change these variables only.

Any other changes below this section are at your own risk and 
discretion. You have been warned.
